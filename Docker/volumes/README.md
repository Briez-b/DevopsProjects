## Docker volumes

There can be different scenarios when containers need to read some files, or make some logs to have these files accessible. It can't be done inside the container because of the nature of them(everytime the container will be destroyed or not run, we lost files inside them).
Some of the possible scenarios

**1) Container application must have a possibility to store logfiles that can be readed anytime and shouldn';t be lost.**
**2) Containers should have a possibility to read files generated by another container(like frontend and bachend containers that leave some json and etc.)**
**3) Containers should have a possibility to read files outside the container that are generated, for example by the end of the day, by the tool like `crontab`**

Two concepts were created for Docker:
### Bind Mounts
You can bind any directory from your host machine to the docker container, so he will always have an access to this dir. This approach os very simple and it is not such good as the next concept, but still used , for example, in development to do some fast testing and etc.
### Docker Volumes

Volumes are similar, you can create volume(it will take some storage from host machine or for example EC2 instance), so we can attach it to any container we want. This soultion is better as we have a better lifecycle:
**1) Volumes can be easy created, destroyed or attached/detached to any container, therefore it is easier to control it.**
**2) We can use not only the memory of our original host, we also can use any memory, such as EC2 instance, external devices and etc.**
How it works? Using Docker cli we can create Volume that will be using the memory on the needed machine (like it is create additional logical disk). And later we attach it to any container we want.

We can also specify if this is read or write volume ("RW: true above"). To do this, we can specify it in --mount parameters.
