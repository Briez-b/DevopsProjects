# EKS cluster

I am going to expose application using EKS cluster

### 1) Create EKS cluster. For this install `kubectl` and `eksctl`. (I did it before). Also some policies should be attached to IAM user, but I just used administrator user.

I will use serverless compute (fargate).

### 2) Add context to kubectl

### 3) Create fargate profile to add one more namespace for our app (without new profiel we can't add new resources to other namespaces, only to default namespace)

Now I can add new resources to game-2048 namespace

### 4) Add the resource with our app by applying .yaml file

### 5) Now we need to add ingress controller to cluster. For that first we need to add oidc provider.

And add alb controller.

For that we have to add new policy (taken from official alb documentation): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/lbc-helm.html

And error occurred because I already had it (i did it during observability practice).

Also create a service account that will be attached to Load balancer controller.

And install ELB controller using helm.

![](https://github.com/Briez-b/DevOpsNotes/blob/main/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241213173243.png)

And now we can see that load balancer created in console:

==Important==. Application load balancer didn't connect to ingress for some reason. So I troubleshooted it:

Firstly checked what is the reason for ingress to not work:

It seems the policy and the role I created before don't have some premission. I found this ticket in github:

![](https://github.com/Briez-b/DevOpsNotes/blob/main/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241213190353.png)

It seems with some update load balancer wants some additional permission. And the policy file I downloaded from documentation is outdated. 

So I updated .json policy file: added 2 new permissions:

![](https://github.com/Briez-b/DevOpsNotes/blob/main/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241213190717.png)

And redone all the steps. 

And now application works:
